# du-dispenser-view
LUA script for dual universe - Dispenser View script

## Installation
1. Place Programming board, Dispenser, Container and a Screen (fits all screen sizes - programmed on S size screen)
2. Link first the screen, then second the container
3. copy the json file (select raw view) and paste it to the PB
4. Upload a custom picture of your sales object to dual universe
4. Adjust the sales, picture and color options, by changing the LUA parameters (No lua programming needed)
5. Set up your dispenser to be ready for sale. (Dispensers cannot be triggered through LUA, so you must insert batch size and price on PB and Dispenser)

## Activation of the programming board
You can use "detection zones", pressure plates or laser emitter to activate the PB.
Currently take care, that the PB is activated for more than 35 seconds - DU only allow update of the container every 30 seconds.
If not it could happen, that the quantity is not updated correct.

If you like my work, i would be happy if you tip me some Quanta to Ingame "SMOURR". Thank you very much.
